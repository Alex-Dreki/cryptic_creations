# TextBasedHorror

This is a simplified text based version of the popular movie series and video game, Friday the 13th. Each time you play and try to escape, your adventure will be different as the probability of escaping changes on your character, villain, and choices!

I am looking to translate this into Shiny so that users can be more emersed in the game. Jumpscares in words aren't as effective as images.
